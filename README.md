<h1> Getting and Cleaning Data Project

######This project takes raw data from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) and Cleanes to an understandable tidy data frame.  This data frame consists data of activites and corresponding sensor readings. certain set of activites had tested individually, each individual was classified as subject. Subject is just number assigned to person/individual.


Steps followed:
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Final result is in *tidy.txt*
