<h1> Getting and Cleaning Data Project

######This project takes raw data from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) and Cleanes to an understandable tidy data frame.  This data frame consists data of activites and corresponding sensor readings. certain set of activites had tested individually, each individual was classified as subject. Subject is just number assigned to person/individual.

In this project I merged training and testing data set and converted Number codes to corresponding labels and added column names
Finally, I further modiefied the tidy data to get a mean/average reading for each subject and each activity.

please go through "codebook.md" to know about codes used in data. [here](https://github.com/kumreddy91/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Coursera/blob/master/codebook.md)
